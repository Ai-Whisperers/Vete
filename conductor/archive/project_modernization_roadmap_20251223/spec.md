# Specification: Project Modernization and Enhancement Roadmap

## 1. Overview
This is a master track that consolidates all 22 previously defined tracks covering architectural improvements, security hardening, technical debt reduction, and feature development into a single, sequential roadmap.

## 2. Goal
The goal of this master track is to systematically execute all defined sub-tracks as phases, thereby improving the overall quality, security, and technology stack of the application in a structured and sequential manner. The detailed requirements for each phase are contained within the corresponding `spec.md` file of the original track.
