# Implementation Plan: Establish DB Optimization Process & Fix Top Query

### Phase 1: Process Definition and Query Identification
- [ ] **Task:** Document the Optimization Process
  - [ ] Sub-task: Draft the `documentation/backend/database-optimization-process.md` document, detailing the steps from identification with the Supabase Dashboard to analysis with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` and final verification.
- [ ] **Task:** Identify Target Query
  - [ ] Sub-task: Navigate to the Supabase dashboard -> Reports -> Query Performance.
  - [ ] Sub-task: Identify the top query listed under "Most time consuming" or "Most frequent".
  - [ ] Sub-task: Document the problematic query, its current performance metrics, and a link to it in the Supabase dashboard.
- [ ] **Task:** Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Process Definition and Query Identification' (Protocol in workflow.md)

### Phase 2: Analysis and Optimization
- [ ] **Task:** Analyze the Query Plan
  - [ ] Sub-task: In the Supabase SQL Editor, run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on the target query.
  - [ ] Sub-task: Analyze the output to determine the bottleneck (e.g., a `Seq Scan` on a large table).
  - [ ] Sub-task: Determine the appropriate optimization, most likely creating a new B-tree index on a key column.
- [ ] **Task:** Implement the Optimization
  - [ ] Sub-task: Create a new Supabase migration file in the `supabase/migrations` directory.
  - [ ] Sub-task: In the new migration file, write the `CREATE INDEX` SQL command to add the necessary index to the relevant table.
  - [ ] Sub-task: Apply the migration to the local database and ensure it succeeds without errors.
- [ ] **Task:** Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Analysis and Optimization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] **Task:** Deploy and Verify
  - [ ] Sub-task: Deploy the new migration to staging and production environments.
  - [ ] Sub-task: After a period of activity (e.g., 24 hours), revisit the Supabase Query Performance dashboard.
  - [ ] Sub-task: Confirm that the target query's performance has improved and it is no longer at the top of the "Most time consuming" list.
  - [ ] Sub-task: Add a screenshot of the improved performance to the track's records for posterity.
- [ ] **Task:** Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Verification' (Protocol in workflow.md)
