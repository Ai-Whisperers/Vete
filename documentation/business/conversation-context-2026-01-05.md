## Key Strategic Decisions (Founder Confirmed)

### Business Model
| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Free tier philosophy | FULL features + Ads | Drive adoption, data continuity between clinics |
| Primary revenue | Subscriptions | Core, predictable income |
| Secondary revenue | E-commerce (3-5%) + Bulk ordering (15-25%) | Network effects |
| Tertiary revenue | Ads + Data licensing + Gov bounties | Fund free tier, long-term |

### Pricing Structure (5 Tiers)
| Tier | Price (PYG) | USD | Target |
|------|-------------|-----|--------|
| Gratis | 0 | $0 | Mass adoption |
| Básico | 100,000 | $14 | Small clinics, ad-free |
| Crecimiento | 200,000 | $27 | Growing, with e-commerce |
| Profesional | 400,000 | $55 | Established, full features |
| Empresarial | Custom | Negotiated | Chains, multi-location |

### Per-User Pricing
- Users = Anyone who logs in (staff + pet owners)
- Extra user costs: Gs 30K-60K depending on tier

### Discounts
- Annual: 20% off
- Referral: 30% stackable per referral
- Early adopter (first 300): Locked rate forever

### Growth Strategy
1. **Proactive outreach**: Scrape ALL clinics, pre-generate websites, offer 3-month trial
2. **Referral program**: 30% discount per referral (stackable), +2 months for referred
3. **Pet owner viral loop**: Pet cards spread awareness when owners visit new clinics
4. **ROI guarantee**: Free 6 months if minimum new clients not acquired

### ROI Guarantee Formula
```
Minimum new clients = Monthly fee ÷ Gs 50,000
"New client" = Pet owner with minimum spend Gs 100,000
Evaluation: After 6 months
If not met: Next 6 months free
```

### Bulk Ordering / GPO
- Access: Crecimiento+ tiers only
- Minimum order: None (aggregate all small orders)
- Payment: 100% upfront (pre-order)
- Delivery: Pass-through cost + 10% markup
- Target margin: 15-25%

### Technical Decisions
- White-label ready (VetePy → AI-Whisperers abstraction)
- Ad network: Google AdSense (start), add direct sales later
- Multi-language: Spanish only for first 2 years
- "Powered by" banner: Top of page with upgrade CTA

### Support Model
| Tier | Support | Response Time |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Gratis | Community forum only | Best effort |
| Básico | Email | 48 hours |
| Crecimiento | Email | 24 hours |
| Profesional | Email + WhatsApp | 12 hours |
| Empresarial | All + Phone + SLA | 4 hours |

## Important Insights from Founder

### Why Free Tier Has Full Features
> "All clinics need full functionality so a premium clinic pet can be treated at a freemium clinic with all data available"

This means: Free tier must have medical records, vaccines, etc. Monetize through ads, not feature gating.

### Growth Philosophy
> "We want to make having the website economic so that it spreads fast and gets adopted easy so we can not only cover Paraguay but if it goes well we can do it for all clinics in all 3rd world countries"

### Referral Model (Stackable)
> "Stackable and overlapping so if they get 130% off they can have 100% next month and 30% the one after instead of giving them money"

### Bulk Ordering Vision
> "We want to add all the small purchases from all clinics to make 1 huge bulk purchase and deliver it all. One cheaper delivery fee that takes it to all clinics."

### Ultimate Vision
> "When AI gets better I will let it run and donate all earnings to humanitarian and animalitarian aid projects"
