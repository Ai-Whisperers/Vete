## 2. Revenue Streams

### Priority Order

1. **Clinic Subscriptions** (Primary) - Gs 100K-400K/month per clinic
2. **E-commerce Commissions** (High Priority) - 3-5% of sales
3. **Bulk Order Margins** (High Potential) - 15-25% margin
4. **Advertising** (Funds Free Tier) - Google AdSense on free tier
5. **Data Licensing** (Year 2+) - Anonymized pet health data
6. **Government Bounties** (Opportunistic) - Sterilization programs

### Revenue Stream Details

#### 2.1 Clinic Subscriptions

```
Target: Gs 200K average per paying clinic

Revenue at scale:
- 100 clinics × Gs 200K = Gs 20M/month (~$2,700 USD)
- 500 clinics × Gs 200K = Gs 100M/month (~$13,700 USD)
```

#### 2.2 E-commerce Commissions

```
Rate: Start at 3%, increase to 5% after 6 months

Example (per clinic with active store):
- Monthly sales: Gs 5,000,000
- Commission at 3%: Gs 150,000
- Commission at 5%: Gs 250,000

Revenue at scale (50 active stores):
- 50 stores × Gs 5M × 4% = Gs 10M/month (~$1,370 USD)
```

#### 2.3 Bulk Ordering / GPO

```
Model: Aggregate orders from all clinics, buy bulk, deliver with margin

Margin: 15-25% (depending on product category)

Example:
- Retail vaccine price: Gs 50,000
- Bulk price (100 units): Gs 35,000
- Vetic margin: Gs 15,000 (30%)

Revenue at scale:
- 100 clinics × Gs 2M orders/month × 20% = Gs 40M/month (~$5,500 USD)
```

**Bulk Ordering Rules:**

- Access: Crecimiento+ tiers only
- Minimum order: None (aggregate all small orders)
- Payment: 100% upfront (pre-order model)
- Delivery: Pass-through cost + 10% markup
- Unfulfilled: Partial delivery + refund OR delay with notification

#### 2.4 Advertising (Free Tier)

```
Network: Google AdSense (start), add direct sales later
Placement: Everywhere except medical consultations
Estimated CPM: $2-5

Revenue at scale (500 free tier clinics):
- 500 clinics × 10,000 impressions × $3 CPM = $15,000/month
```

#### 2.5 Data Licensing (Year 2+)

```
Data types:
- Breed distribution by region
- Common diagnoses by breed/age
- Vaccine coverage rates
- Treatment outcomes
- Seasonal disease patterns

Target buyers:
- Pharmaceutical companies
- Pet food companies
- Insurance companies
- Universities
- Government/NGOs

Revenue potential: $50,000-200,000/year (at 1000+ clinics)
```

#### 2.6 Government Bounties

```
Model: Track sterilizations, report to government, take 10-15% commission

Example (Paraguay):
- Government bounty: $30/sterilization
- Clinic receives: $25-27
- Vetic commission: $3-5

Revenue potential: $30,000/year (10,000 procedures)

## Appendix A: Sales Talking Points

### For Small Clinics (Gratis → Básico)

> "You can start completely free and get a professional website, appointment booking, and pet portal. When you're ready to remove ads and get priority support, it's only Gs 100,000/month - less than one consultation fee."

### For Growing Clinics (Crecimiento)

> "With our e-commerce integration, you can sell products online with just 3% commission - much lower than marketplaces. Plus, bulk ordering saves you 15-25% on supplies."

### For Established Clinics (Profesional)

> "The hospitalization and lab modules alone save you 5+ hours per week. WhatsApp integration means clients can reach you directly. And we guarantee ROI - if you don't get at least 8 new clients in 6 months, the next 6 months are free."

### ROI Guarantee Pitch

> "We're so confident you'll grow with us that we guarantee it. Calculate your monthly fee ÷ Gs 50,000 = minimum new clients. Don't hit that in 6 months? Your next 6 months are on us."

## Appendix B: FAQ

**Q: Why is the free tier so generous?**
A: We want every clinic in the ecosystem. Free clinics generate ad revenue, contribute to data insights, and eventually upgrade when they grow.

**Q: How do you make money if most clinics are free?**
A: Multiple streams: ads on free tier, subscriptions, e-commerce commissions, bulk order margins. One paying clinic covers 10 free ones.

**Q: What if a clinic never upgrades from free?**
A: That's okay! They still generate ad revenue (~$30-50/month), contribute to data value, and spread awareness. Their pet owners may go to paying clinics too.

**Q: Why per-user pricing?**
A: Fairness. A 2-person clinic shouldn't pay the same as a 20-person clinic. This scales naturally with clinic size.

**Q: What's the ROI guarantee catch?**
A: No catch. We track new client registrations automatically. If you don't hit the threshold, next 6 months are free. We believe in our platform that much.
