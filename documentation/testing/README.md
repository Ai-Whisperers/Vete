## How to Use This Documentation

### For Test Implementation

1. **Understand the Problem:** Read `00-PROBLEM-ANALYSIS.md` to understand why we need tests
2. **Start with Strategy:** Read `01-TEST-STRATEGY.md` to understand overall approach
3. **Review Critique:** Read `02-PLATFORM-CRITIQUE.md` to understand current state
4. **Review Automation:** Read `plans/TEST_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md` for execution details
5. **Implement Tests:** Use feature/screen/API/action plans as implementation guides
6. **Follow Patterns:** Use component and E2E plans for testing patterns

### For Test Planning

1. **Identify Feature:** Find relevant test plan document in `plans/`
2. **Review Requirements:** Check test coverage requirements
3. **Plan Implementation:** Use test cases as implementation checklist
4. **Track Progress:** Mark test cases as implemented

### For Code Reviews

1. **Check Coverage:** Verify tests match test plan requirements
2. **Review Quality:** Ensure tests follow best practices
3. **Validate Completeness:** Confirm all test cases covered

## Current Status

**Overall Test Coverage:** ~20% (Target: 75%)

**Critical Gaps:**
- 80% of features have no tests
- 73 of 83 API endpoints untested
- <5% component test coverage
- Limited E2E coverage

**Priority:** Implement Phase 1 (Critical Paths) immediately.
