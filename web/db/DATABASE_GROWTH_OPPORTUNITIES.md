## Conclusion

The current database provides a solid operational foundation. The growth opportunities fall into three buckets:

1. **Engagement** - Keep pet owners coming back with health scores, wellness tracking, and communication
2. **Revenue** - Subscription plans and boarding create recurring/ancillary revenue
3. **Scale** - Network features enable growth beyond single clinics

The highest-ROI investments are **wellness plans** (recurring revenue) and **telemedicine** (modern expectations, reduced no-shows). These should be prioritized.
